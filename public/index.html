   <h1>Body detection</h1>
   <p>
     Below are various sketches for inspiration. The last two sketches demonstrates how to send and receive body data between different instances possibly on different devices

   <ul>
      <li><a href="sketches/playground/">playground</a>: see how body detection works by checking different body parts an inspecting data</li>
   </ul>

   Sketches for extending. They are listed in ascending complexity.
   <ul>
      <li><a href="sketches/speed-of-nose/">Speed of nose</a>: Demonstrates how to get the speed (m/s) of a body part exemplified by the nose. Also, draws eyes as stars</li>
      <li><a href="sketches/wrist-distance/">Wrist distance</a>: Demonstrates how to get the distance (m) between two body parts in this case left and right wrist</li>
      <li><a href="sketches/multibody/">Multiple bodies</a>: Demonstrates how to track multiple bodies from one camera. When multiple bodies are detected with the same camera data are 2D. No depth (z-value) is available and measurements are in pixels not meters</li>

      <li><a href="sketches/send-bodies/">Send bodies</a>: Demonstrate how to send body data to a remote listener, e.g., on another device</li>
      <li><a href="sketches/receive-bodies/">Receive bodies</a>: Demonstrates how to receive bodies from one or more devices</li>
